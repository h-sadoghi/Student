    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Geometric Interpretation**\n",
    "\n",
    "The proximal mapping can be thought of as finding a point $ u $ that balances:\n",
    "- The value of the function $ f(u) $, which is often non-differentiable.\n",
    "- The squared distance $ \\frac{1}{2\\lambda} \\| u - x \\|^2 $ from the point $ x $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trade-off can be interpreted as a form of regularization where the function $ f $ is smoothed out or approximated by adding a quadratic penalty.\n",

    "**Proximal Mapping** helps in handling optimization problems with non-differentiable regularization terms. For Lasso regression, the proximal operator is used to solve the $ L_1 $ regularization term efficiently. By combining gradient descent with the proximal operator, we can effectively solve the Lasso regression problem and find sparse solutions for the coefficients."
